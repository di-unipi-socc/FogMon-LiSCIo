fixes:
    changed getSource function to use getnameinfo for name resolution instead of using the raw ip.
    changed exit condition for the program: 0 to exit.
    fixed recv and write for errno == EINPROGRESS.
    fixed bugs on leader crash.
    fixed bugs on gossiping protocol.
    added valgrind version for debug of crashes.
    fixed sensibility problems resulting in not sending any update on Bandwidth and Latency
    fixed slow test in bandwidth: there was a problem in the order in least recently measured bandwidth in follower
    fixed close sockets in queue when switching from leader to follower (causing other follower to be hanging)

New:
    Added interface service
        Added leader and sub nodes (at the time of convergence)
        Add relative usage of the bandwidth (and data in MB/s)

Problems:
    too slow leader sendMReport? 100 seconds... reason: slow in adding report to db
        tmp solution: respond first
    retry query if locked

Possible improvments:
    change of follower association method?
    mean of tests in follower (20 too many not reactive?)
    not removing leader when follower decrease...
    divide bandwidth estimates from organisation layer (because is estimed better doing random sample)
    tune assolo estimates
    
    take note of the quality and use that to decide later

Necessary improvments:
    multithread of tests
    slow in becoming leader from follower (beacuse tests take too much time (bandwidht mainly))
    add queue for single processing of storage data (too slow, and shouldnt occupy the connection threads)
    update scripts with new clustering class, and make more tries for node (maybe 2-3)
